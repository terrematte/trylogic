<h3>Exhaustiveness</h3>

<p>One of the benefit of pattern-matching is the exhaustiveness check
  done by the compiler statically. Indeed, the OCaml compiler can
  verify that all the cases are handled. For instance, when
  pattern-matching on a list, the compiler will warn
  the user if she forgets to handle the empty list case:

<pre><code>let head_partial = function
  | h::_ -> h
</code></pre>

Moreover, the compiler will also warm the user when a case is handled
multiple times or when a case is unused:

<pre><code>let head = function
  | []   -> failwith "empty list"
  | h::_ -> h
  | [h]  -> h
</code></pre>

</p>
