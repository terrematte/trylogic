<h3>Variables</h3>

<p>As in other languages, you can associate a name to a value. To do
that, we use the <code>let</code> syntax which associates the result
of some computation with a name:</p>

<p><code>let x = 6 * 7</code></p>

<br />

<p>We can now check the value associated with <code>x</code> in the
toplevel:</p>
<p><code>x</code></p>

<br />
<p>And we can use the name where we would like the value:</p>
<p><code>let y = x + 1</code></p>
