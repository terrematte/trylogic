<h3>Congratulations</h3>

<p>You have seen that OCaml allows you to use some imperative style of
programming. Some functional programmers will tell you that
side-effects are bad: they are right, in many cases, but don't listen
to them too early !</p>


<p>In the next lessons, you will see that by combining both imperative
and functional programming styles, you can do wonders !</p>

<p>Use <code>next()</code> to go to the next lesson !</p>
