<h3>Operations on Tuples</h3>

<p>A tuple consists of values (zero or more), enclosed in parentheses
and separated by commas. Note that you can have differents types for
each element, remember</p>
<p><code>(42, "John", true)</code></p>

<br />
<p>When you have a pair (a tuple with two elements), you can use some
predefined functions like get the first element:</p>
<p><code>fst (42, "John")</code></p>

<br />
<p>Or the second element:</p>
<p><code>snd (42, "John")</code></p>
