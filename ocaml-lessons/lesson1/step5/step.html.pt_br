<h3>More operations on strings</h3>

<p>There are many operations available on strings, like a function
which returns a copy of the argument, with all uppercase letters
translated to lowercase:</p>
<p><code>String.lowercase "MARY"</code></p>

<br />
<p>Here's a more practical example, generating a filename from components: </p>
<p><code>String.concat "/" [""; "usr"; "local"; "bin"]</code></p>
<p>Note that the second argument is a list of strings.</p>

<br />
<p>It is sometimes useful to extract an integer from a string. This is
easy in OCaml:</p>
<p><code>int_of_string "546"</code></p>
