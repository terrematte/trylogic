<h3>Mutable Variables</h3>

<p>In OCaml, you cannot change the value associated with a name after
its definition. Trying to do so will trigger a compilation error:</p>
<p><code>x <- x + 1</code></p>

<p>You will better understand the error message later.</p>

<br />
<p>If you really want to modify the value associated with a name, you
must use a trick. OCaml provides a function <code>ref</code> that
creates a special value that can be modified later (a reference):</p>
<p><code>let x = ref 42</code></p>

<br />
<p>You can then change the value of the reference associated
with <code>x</code> using the <code>:=</code> operator:</p>
<p><code>x := 100 / 4</code></p>

<br />
<p>You can also access the value contained in the reference using the
operator <code>!</code>:</p>

<p><code>let y = !x + 1</code></p>
