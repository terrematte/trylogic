<h3>Basic operations on strings</h3>

<p>Strings are sequences of chars. It is possible to create a
string from just one char, using:</p>
<p><code>String.make 10 'x'</code></p>

<br />
<p>Strings can also be created by joining other strings:</p>
<p><code>"Mary" ^ " and " ^ "John"</code></p>

<br />
<p>It might also be interesting to get the length of a string:</p>

<p><code>String.length "abcdefghijklmnopqstuvwxyz"</code></p>

<p>(and yes, one character is missing !)</p>
