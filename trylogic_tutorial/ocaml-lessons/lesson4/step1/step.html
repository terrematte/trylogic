<h3>Pattern-matching on integers</h3>

<p>A powerful feature of OCaml is pattern-matching.

  For simple values as integers, pattern-matching is quite similar to
  case switches in other languages (<em>_</em> corresponds to the
  default case). Moreover, each case is handled in chronological order:

<pre><code>let string_of_int x = match x with
   | 0 -> "zero"
   | 1 -> "one"
   | 2 -> "two"
   | _ -> "many"
</code></pre>

In this case, the pattern matching is done on the last function
argument, so this function can be rewritten in a shorter form:

<pre><code>let string_of_int = function
    | 0 -> "zero"
    | 1 -> "one"
    | 2 -> "two"
    | _ -> "many"
</code></pre>

</p>
